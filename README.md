### <ins>Feature 4: Use the App **When** Offline</ins>
As a user, I should be able to use the app **when** offline so that I may have access to the appâ€™s services **when** an internet connection is unavailable.
#### Scenario 1: Show cached data when there is no internet connection
**Given** the user has previously accessed the app and cached data is available, **when** there is no internet connection, **then** the app should display the cached data.

## How Serverless Functions Will Be Used
In the context of the Meet app, serverless functions will be used to:
* Fetch Google Calendar events: Serverless architecture ensures seamless scalability to handle varying loads of calendar data fetching.
* Work offline: When the app is offline, these functions can handle the retrieval and display of cached data from the previous user session.
* Create a shortcut for the app on the device's home screen
* Filter events and process data: Assist in processing and filtering events by city, as well as handling the logic for specifying and displaying the number of events.
* Generate real-time charts visualizing event details
* Handle errors due to changes to search settings while offline
